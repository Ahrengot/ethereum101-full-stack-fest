# Steps

* First contract
  * Explain we are going to do code first just like they are already used to
  * Open browser to Remix
  * Choose `Javascript VM`
  * Type or copy `GameOfTag` contract
  * Explain in-browser blockchain
  * Deploy contract in-browser
* Try to interact with others
  * Paste address in comments
  * Try to play with other people's contract, doesn't work, because multiple blockchains / networks
  * Tag your own contract or someone else outside your browser
  * Find out you just killed your contract by tagging someone not on network
* Go to Ropsten
  * We need to be on same network: Ropsten
  * Download Metamask
  * Choose `Injected Web3`
  * Deploy on Ropsten. Oh no Ether?
  * Get 0.5 Ether from [faucet](http://ipfs.b9lab.com:8080/ipfs/QmVAwVKys271P5EQyEfVSxm7BJDKWt42A2gHvNmxLjZMps/)
  * Deploy on Ropsten
  * Have someone certify code with Etherscan
* Interact with others
  * Paste your addresses: your public address and your `GameTag` address in comments

  * Type or copy `King` contract
  * Explain that you can associate money to function calls
  * Deploy contract to Ropsten
* Interact with others
  * Paste address in comments
  * Try to capture other people's contract
* Code review
  * What are the problems with this contract?
  * How serious are the flaws in this contract?
  * What can we do to fix it?
  * Oops the deployed contract is immutable. The Ether is lost unless there is a greater fool.
* Blockchain data structure?
* Blockchain consensus?
